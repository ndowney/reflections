-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I would want to share my work with others, or possibly, when I want to switch computers for my work, like when I go home and want to use my desktop there rather than my work computer.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to do then when I have something I am not ready to share with the world yet, like a new release that has no testing yet or something like that.  i would push it when I felt it was ready for the world to see.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are new repositories created from other ones on github.  A clone is a copy of a repository, which can be on github or on my local machine.  A branch is a particular part of a repository concerned with a specific version of the files in that repository.  Fork is a github feature, I would use it to make my own version of a piece of software authored by someone else. I would use a branch for a code feature that isnt fully working yet, and clone to get a copy of a repository on my machine for offline use.
