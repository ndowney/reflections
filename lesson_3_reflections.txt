-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I would want to share my work with others, or possibly, when I want to switch computers for my work, like when I go home and want to use my desktop there rather than my work computer.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to do then when I have something I am not ready to share with the world yet, like a new release that has no testing yet or something like that.  i would push it when I felt it was ready for the world to see.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are new repositories created from other ones on github.  A clone is a copy of a repository, which can be on github or on my local machine.  A branch is a particular part of a repository concerned with a specific version of the files in that repository.  Fork is a github feature, I would use it to make my own version of a piece of software authored by someone else. I would use a branch for a code feature that isnt fully working yet, and clone to get a copy of a repository on my machine for offline use.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can make sure that any changes I have made are consistent with those on the remote by merging my current branch with the local copy of the remote branch before pushing my changes to the remote.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be easier to share changes with my collaborators, and also to get group consensus on changes using github, but one thing that might be harder is getting all the users to use the tools properly, especially github.  With git and a single remote repository, it might be ok.  Also there is a bit to know before using git/github, which would make it hard to work with people unfamialliar with them
